RFM Customer Segmentation Analysis
This repository contains a Python project utilizing the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to perform powerful customer segmentation on transactional data. The analysis identifies distinct customer groups based on their purchasing habits, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing and customer retention strategies.

Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to transform raw customer transaction data into valuable business intelligence by classifying customers into strategic segments (e.g., Champions, At-Risk, New, Lost). This classification is crucial for maximizing Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and optimizing resource allocation.

Key Features & Methodology
The Jupyter Notebook (RFM.ipynb) executes a complete RFM analysis pipeline:

Data Preparation: Handles missing values (specifically for CustomerID) and calculates the TotalSum (Quantity x UnitPrice) for all transactions.

RFM Calculation: Computes the core metrics for each customer:

Recency (R): Days since the last purchase.

Frequency (F): Total number of transactions.

Monetary Value (M): Total revenue generated by the customer.

RFM Scoring: Utilizes quartile-based scoring (1 to 4) for each metric to rank customers, combining them into a final RFM Score.

Customer Segmentation: Maps the calculated RFM scores to strategic customer groups with tailored business descriptions.

 Identified Customer Segments (Key Insights)
The analysis successfully identifies and characterizes major customer segments:

High-Value Customers / Champions (R=4, F=4, M=4): These customers score high in all three metrics. They are the most loyal and profitable group for the brand.

At-Risk Customers (High F & M, Low R): Customers who were once loyal and profitable but have not purchased recently.

New Customers (High R, Moderate F & M): Customers who have purchased very recently but have moderate frequency and monetary scores, showing high potential for future loyalty.

Churned Customers / Lost (Low R, F, M): Customers who haven't purchased recently, buy infrequently, and spend less.
